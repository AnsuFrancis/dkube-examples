  - Image Shape: Height:200, Width:200, Channels:1, Channel order: Channels Last
  - timezone as UTC.

### 2. Drift Monitoring

3. **Add Predict Data**:
- Select dataset content as **Cloudevents**.
     

### 3. Performance Monitoring
1. Check Enable and provide frequency as 5 minutes.
2. In Compute Metrics select Labelled dataset
  -  Select dataset `image-mm-kf-s3`.
  -  Prefix/subpath: {deployment ID}/livedata
  -  Dataset Format : Tabular
  -  Date suffix is yyyy/dd/mm/hh
  -  Fill Prediction column name as output
  -  Fill Groundtruth column name as "label".
  -  Fill timestamp column as "timestamp"

3. Click on Submit.
